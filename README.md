## Tinytorch: A Deep Learning Library Written in Numpy

Welcome to tinytorch! Tinytorch is a small proof-of-concept library for those interested in learning how to write their own deep learning library in numpy. Naturally, it isn't meant for production purposes. Rather, tinytorch means to serve as a guide for those who want to really sink their teeth into the internals of neural nets.  

## What Can Tinytorch Do?

Tinytorch is under active development and new features will be added periodically. At the current moment, tinytorch includes  

- [x] Datasets & Dataloaders
- [x] Feedforward networks
- [ ] Convolutional neural nets
- [ ] Recurrent neural nets
- [ ] GPU support via `numba`
